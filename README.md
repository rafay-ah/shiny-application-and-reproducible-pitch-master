# Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

This repository contains the files required for the Data Products course project. The goal of the project is:

1. To create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers, and
2. To prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about this application.

The code used for the Shiny application can be found under: [https://github.com/pvv88/shiny-application-and-reproducible-pitch](https://github.com/pvv88/shiny-application-and-reproducible-pitch).

The application itself provides quality prediction of wines. It is available online under the following link: [https://pvv88.shinyapps.io/project](https://pvv88.shinyapps.io/project).


The reproducible pitch presentation about this application is available under: [http://rpubs.com/pvv88/presentation](http://rpubs.com/pvv88/presentation).

The code used for preparing the pitch presentation, as well as the generated HTML file, can be found under: [https://github.com/pvv88/shiny-application-and-reproducible-pitch](https://github.com/pvv88/shiny-application-and-reproducible-pitch).
